Overview
========

Each movie will be self-contained in a directory of the exact same name (see
filenaming convention for more details). In this directory might also live
subtitles files.

All this movie directories themselves lives in a parent directory named after
the first letter of their name.

For example, `A/American Beauty/` will hold `American Beauty.avi` and `American
Beauty [FR].srt`.

Numbers
=======

Movies starting with a number will all be grouped in a special directory named
`0-9`.

For example, `99F.avi` full path will be `0â€“9/99F/99F.avi`.

Saga
====

If several movies are part of a main saga, I add an intermediate folder named
after the saga.

For example, all Batman movies will be in `B/Batman/`.

Then, each movie folder in the saga gets prefix with the index of this movie in
the saga, prefix with a `0` if need be.  A saga can be incomplete, but the
folders must still be named according to the full released saga. 

For example, here is what my `Batman/` folder look like :

	B/
		Batman/
			01 - Batman/
				Batman.avi
			02 - Batman Returns/
				Batman Returns.avi
			05 - Batman Begins/
				Batman Begins.avi
			06 - Dark Knight (The)/
				Dark Knight (The).avi
