Overview
========

Movies come in a wide variety of format and encodings. I prefer having `mkv`
files holding an `h264` video stream and `ogg` audio stream, but must of the
time will allow any `avi` file with non-exotic video/audio encoding.

On the other hand, I do not want any `wmw`, `asf` or `mov` file.

Subtitles
=========

Subtitle files must be in `srt` format.
