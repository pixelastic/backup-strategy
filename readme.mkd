This repo holds documentation on how I want my files to be saved.

I do have a lot of different files, on different computers or devices. Some of
it is code, some of it is media files.

This will try to put a bit of order in all this chaos and try to find the best
way to organize my stuff and back it up so I do not have to worry about losing
anything.
